As a Senior Platform Engineer, I believe in treating every professional artifact—including my career history—with the same rigour as production infrastructure. This repository hosts my resume, managed as a **GitOps-driven CI/CD pipeline**.

## 🏗️ The System Architecture
This project demonstrates a full "Document-as-Code" lifecycle, mirroring the **Golden Path** patterns I implement for enterprise cloud environments.
